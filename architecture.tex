	\section{Introduction}
    \subsection{Purpose}
	\subsection{Scope}
	
	\section{External Interface Requirements}
	\subsection{User Interface}
	NavUp's user interface is clear, simple to understand, concise, familiar, responsive, attractive and easy to use. It is designed to the standard guides specified by googles materiel design on mobile devices. This ensures that the user has a stress free experience when interacting with it. 
	The application is effective, efficient resulting in a satisfied user.
	
    \paragraph{References to GUI standards and product family style guides that are to be followed by NavUP: } 
		
		As previously mentioned google material design standards will be adhered to while designing NavUP’s graphical user interface. Mainly because we expect the NavUP application to be used on mobile devices. 
		Google has a well-defined set of rules that stand to the classic principles of good design and graphics specifically for mobile interfaces. The goal is to create a visual language that synthesizes good design with innovation and technology. 
		
	\paragraph{Standards for fonts, icons, button and labels, images and colour schemes } 
	
	Typography is a ‘make or break’ for any mobile application because of the limited screen sizes and resolution. Although fonts may be customizable by the user, depending on their preference, the default font used in the NavUP application is “Open Sans”.
	
	 Open Sans is a sans-serif typeface that is designed with open forms and a natural appearance so it’s easy to read. It is optimized for print, web as well as mobile interfaces. It has great legibility characteristics in its letterforms and adapts well with various styles.

	\paragraph{Colour Schemes}
	
	Colour schemes in material designed is mostly motivated by deep bold shades compared with soft environments, deep shadows and bright highlights. NavUP will incorporate a combination of fresh, warm and cool colours. Each colour will react differently when an action is triggered within the application. Tints and shades will adjust accordingly to let the user know that an action has been taken. Below are the standards for appropriate values for each to ensure consistency and harmony. The standard is 20% return rate

		\paragraph{Icons, buttons and images}
	
 Material icons and images use geometric shapes to visually prepresent core ideas and capabilities. NavUp incorporates both application/product icons as well as system icons. \newline

Application icons visually express the application or brands product and services. For example, the NavUP logo or icon. It would be simple, bold and friendly to communicate the core ide and intent of the product/application. To help user navigate their way around campus, in this case. The application icon is the brand identity.

	A system icon, or UI icon, symbolizes a command, file, device, or directory. System icons are used to represent common actions. Below are sample system icons that are find in the NavUp application. Icons are required to be simple, consistent, intuitive and related to an action.\newline

	For Square Icons:
	Height: 152 dp
	Width: 152 dp
	For circular icons:
	Diameter: 176 dp
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item\textbf {Grid dimension requirierens :} \newline
		All grid icons have been developed to facilitate consistency and institute a clear set of rules for the positing of graphics elements. Icon dimension requirements are as follows:\newline \newline
		 \textbf{For Square Icons:} 
		\item \textbf{Height:} 152 dp
		\item \textbf{Width:} 152 dp \newline \newline
	\textbf{For circular icons:} 
		\item \textbf{Diameter:} 176 dp
	\end{itemize}

	\subsection{Hardware Interface}
	\subsection{Software Interface}
	There are 3 client-side platforms we will be working with namely IOS, Android and web, which will all be comunicating through a common access point, i.e. the web server.  Although all 3 platforms will interact with a web based API, it is important to note that 2 of those platforms will be dealing with a native OS and will have to interact with it appropriately.  To be more specific, when dealing with Android OS, the more popular solution will be interfacing with a java virtual machine, whereas with IOS, we will be interacting with Swift, a popular developer language for most Apple based products.  
	
	The Software on the server-side must be capable of gathering the appropriate information from the available clients for statistical purposes to generate for example the heat maps to indicate congestion on a given route.  Furthermore, the server-side software must effectively handle incoming requests and outgoing responses to prevent any and all bottlenecking to the best of its ability.  Client-side software should be able to generate meaningful information to user it receives from the server to allow the user to make appropriate decisions.  
	\subsection{Communication}
	The software will interact primarily through a WIFI connection to send requests and recieve responses from the local server.  The most commonly used WIFI frequency is measured at 2.4 GHz, although a more recent upgrade has made use of the 5.0 GHz frequency bandwidth capable of transferring data at a much faster rate.  Thus if the hardware is capable of providing both speeds, the software should be compatable with both, and not cause a bottleneck for devices capable of the higher transfer rate, but also allow for slower connections to be possible.  
	
	If a web based API is used as a back-end technology, communication will be easy when using a web server, and web-client.  However when working with native IOS and Android, libraries will need to be included to make comunication possible.  Thus for example making use of sockets to establish connection, and read/write buffer streams for sending and recieving data to and from the web server.  
	
	\section{Performance Requirements}
	\paragraph{The system should be able to run in the following way: }
	\begin{itemize}
	\item The system will be run through campus servers as well as web servers.
	\item The performance of the application will be dependent on the user’s hardware device.
	\item The loading time of each page will be dependent on the strength of the user’s internet connection as well as the number of users currently using campus Wi-Fi.
	\item The time it takes to log in will be dependent on the internet connection.
	\item All new users should be added to the system in less than a second however, it may take the user longer to see this, depending on the internet connection.
	\item Users should be sent notifications as soon as they are available on the system.
	\item Admin should be able to access the GIS module as well as user module with ease in less than a second as these details will be located on campus servers.
	\item Points of interest should appear as soon as a user searches for a location or searches for a specific point of interest however, this will once again be dependent on the internet connection.
	\item Users should be able to search, delete, save as well as modify their route. This should be able to take place quickly. Saving and modifying will be dependent on the user and searching and deleting will be dependent on the internet connection.
	\item Rendering display service will differ from device to device while requesting service relies on the internet connection.
	\item Push services for events should happen as soon as the event has been added to the application
	\item Fitness service and heat maps should be updated in real time.
	\end{itemize}
	
	\section{Design Constraints}
	This section describes restrictions on design alternatives regarding standards and limitations of hardware capabilities
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item \textbf{Storage space}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \textbf{Description:} The amount of storage space required by the application must be within the maximum storage limits of a budget phone to accomodate a range of phones typically used by students.
			\item \textbf{Maximum:} 90MB
			\item \textbf{Reasonable:} 40MB
			\item \textbf{Optimal:} 10MB.\newline
		\end{itemize}
	
		\item \textbf{Memory usage}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \textbf{Description:} The amount of RAM used by the application should be a reasonable amount considering that many smartphones used by students only have a capacity of 1GB RAM.
			\item \textbf{Maximum:} 100MB
			\item \textbf{Reasonable:} 90MB
			\item \textbf{Optimal:} 40MB.\newline
		\end{itemize}
		
		\item \textbf{Data Retrieval}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \textbf{Description:} The return rate of data from relevant databases such as the GIS database should be close to perfect in order to prevent delays and inaccurate navigation.
			\item \textbf{Minimal:} 98% return rate
			\item \textbf{Reasonable:} 99% return rate
			\item \textbf{Optimal:} 100% return rate.\newline
		\end{itemize}
		
		\item \textbf{Networks and Location}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \textbf{Description:} The system will need to make use of Wi-Fi, mobile networks and GPS in order to enhance accuracy of location and results as far as possible. In addition, the system will need to use relevant networks in the their respective areas (i.e., using GPS within buildings is pointless).
			\item \textbf{Minimal:} 98% accuracy
			\item \textbf{Reasonable:} 99% accuracy
			\item \textbf{Optimal:} 100% accuracy.\newline
		\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
	
	\section{Software System Attributes}
	\subsection{Reliability}
	When transferring data from point A to point B, it is crucial that the integrity of every piece of information be maintained and accounted for.  One piece of misinformation could very well mean the difference between the locations of two different class rooms or even completely different buildings.  One of the applications features is to ensure the fastest route, which relies heavily on making the right decisions based on the data it receives, therefore if the information is not accurate or even correct, the user could end up late to their desired destination.
	\subsection{Robustness}
	All functionality of NavUP must work correctly even under exceptional conditions; The most important being correctness when there is no Wi-Fi connection, extremely slow Internet connectivity or low availability of resources on either the host system for each access channel or the server.
	
	The data module should provide means of communication even when the server is under strain in order to be robust. This may be done in terms of a pipeline system where messages are queued and receipt of them are acknowledged, along with the error detection and correction discussed under Reliability.
	\subsection{Efficiency}
	Sending data between remote locations relies heavily on the network traffic and its capabilities/limitations.  Thus the idea would be to put the least amount of stress and congestion on that network and only make strategic requests from client to server.  The idea would be to make relatively frequent requests to small yet crucial information, and much less frequent requests to information that is less likely to change within a small period of time.
	\subsection{Interoperability}
	\subsection{Maintainability}
	\subsection{Testability}
	\subsection{Portability}
	\subsubsection{Hardware Independence}
	Seeing as how the system will be deployed with a web base as a back-end API, the hardware choices are not limited to a specific set of components, so long as they meet the minimum or preferably recommended requirements to be able to handle the estimated network traffic to keep the system performing at optimal levels.
	\subsubsection{Software Dependence}
	The software on the other hand will be limited to being web specific, i.e. being able to use or integrate with applications like AJAX, Node etc.
	\subsection{Reusability}
	\subsection{Modularity}
	\subsection{Cohesion}
	The NavUP system can be designed with the high cohesion principle in mind.  The system as a whole should be formulated in to a hierarchical tree-structure, comprising of subsystems, or modules.  The modules should be able to either function independently, or be able to call on one or more modules in the hierarchy to perform a given task.  Thus adding or removing modules should not break the system so much as increase or reduce  its functionality as a whole.
	
	The Data module comprises mainly out of a client and a server subsystem.  The server for example would be able to make use of a Database Management System, for handling records relevant to the NavUP system, such as location information, events etc.  Furthermore, both the Client and Server would need to have some form of communication method, which could also be in the form of a subsystem or module.
	
	One of the more beneficial advantages of modularity is the fact that a module/subsystem can be focused on to either make improvements or even completely swap it out for another more efficient subsystem to improve overall performance.
	\subsection{Coupling}
	The subsystems should have minimal impact on and dependency on the other subsystems of the system. The system as a whole applies the low coupling principle. Subsystems should be abstracted and implementation changes should only affect the subsystem that was modified. This abstraction layer will provide an interface between all the subsystems that prevents interference and augments communication between them.
	
	The data module will be represented as a module with requests and responses that are used both by access channels and the server. This allows for other subsystems to easily use it without having to worry about implementation specific details and the implementation can be changed to use a different technology or update the application programming interface (API).
	
	\section{Technologies}
	\subsection{Data}
	Message passing is done in a transactional manner in this subsystem. The access channels, or clients, need a way to send requests to the server and receive responses. Likewise, the server needs a way to service requests and issue responses. The University of Pretoria Wi-Fi infrastructure can be advantageous in this scenario as we can assume the user is likely connected to the Wi-Fi and fall back on cellular data otherwise. This is done by having the server accessible both locally and publicly via the Internet. If a connection cannot be established to the local server a connection via cellular data or a different Wi-Fi connection is made to the server.
	
	The connection is established via either the HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP), or it's secured counterpart HTTPS that makes use of the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) depending on the nature of the message contents, and is maintained only for the duration of the message send and receive process. The requests will, more specifically, be made using Asynchronous JSON and XML (AJAX) and will always be paired with a response. The protocol that HTTP is built on, the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), ensures the delivery of messages in the correct order and that the messages remain intact.
